# kio-scaffold

A Claude Code **plugin marketplace** for Harness Engineering tooling.

> **Harness Engineering** = designing the *work environment itself* so that an AI
> can do good work on its own. This marketplace ships a plugin that sets that
> environment up for you automatically.

## Install

```bash
# 1) Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add jsk4581/kio-scaffold

# 2) Install the plugin
claude plugin install harness@kio-scaffold
```

Once installed, the `/harness:scaffold` skill is ready to use.

## What's inside

### `harness` — Harness Engineering toolkit

| Skill | Invoke | What it does |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| scaffold | `/harness:scaffold` | Generates `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/rules/` + a role-based folder structure in one pass. Interviews you for the stack and scope first, then fills everything in. On an existing project it also runs in a diagnose/simplify mode. |

#### What `/harness:scaffold` creates

```

Core principles: User→Project→Folder scope inheritance, Progressive Disclosure,
double safety on boundaries, and "a good harness gets *simpler* over time."

### Inter-agent collaboration (optional)

When multiple agents or sessions work on one project — sequentially or
concurrently — they coordinate through files under `.dev/collab/`:

- **`handoff/`** — handoff notes for passing work to the next agent (what's done,
  what's left, gotchas, how to verify).
- **`DECISIONS.md`** — a lightweight shared decision log.
- **`BOARD.md`** — a live work board: who is doing what.
- **`claims/`** — per-task locks that prevent two agents from grabbing the same work.

**Git separation:** durable records (`handoff/`, `DECISIONS.md`) are committed for
sharing and review, while volatile live state (`BOARD.md`, `claims/`) is gitignored
to avoid merge conflicts. It's **opt-in** — single-agent projects skip it entirely
(an empty coordination folder is just noise).
